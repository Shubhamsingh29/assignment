# Drug-Review-Dataset
Analyzing the Drugs Descriptions, conditions, reviews and then recommending it using Deep Learning Models, for each Health Condition of a Patient.



# Here are just a couple ideas as to what you could do with the data:

# Classification: 
Can you predict the patient's condition based on the review?

# Regression:
Can you predict the rating of the drug based on the review?

# Sentiment analysis: 
What elements of a review make it more helpful to others? Which patients tend to have more negative reviews? Can you determine if a review is positive, neutral, or negative?

# Data visualizations: 
What kind of drugs are there? What sorts of conditions do these patients have?


# Complex:
How many domains of analysis and topics does this Kernel cover? Does it attempt machine learning methods? Does the Kernel offer a variety of unique analyses and interesting conclusions or solutions?

# Original: 
What is the subject matter of this Kernel? Does it have a well-defined and interesting project scope, narrative or problem? Could the results make an impact? Is it thought provoking?

# Approachable: 
How easy is it to understand this Kernel? Are all thought processes clear? Is the code clean, with useful comments? Are visualizations and processes articulated and self-explanatory?
